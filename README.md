# healthcare-sql-final-project
My submitted final project for the CFG Data and SQL course 2023, this was my first introduction into using SQL.
It allowed me to learn about and practise different actions such as
- database creation with use of relational tables
- queries, subqueries and group by
- views and joins
- stored functions and procedures
- EER diagram construction
